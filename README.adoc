= IvyPot - A Gradle plugin for Off-line Repositories
:revnumber:0.9

Not all development teams have the luxury of relying on Maven Central, Bintray for day to day development. Some of them
are still fortunate to proxy public repositories via in-house Artifactory or Nexus instances. Others have even more
strict requirements including the ability to be able to build an isolated environment. This plugin is for them. It allows
for public dependencies, including transitive dependencies, to be downloaded in a controlled manner and the internal
security processes to be applied to the binary files before committing them to an internal storage area.

== Gradle minimum versions

* As from 0.9 the minimum supported Gradle version is 5.0. I have very little time to maintain this low usage plugin, so trying to make it compatible with 4.0 as well is too much effort. There is no feature change from 0.8, so if you need to use Gradle 4.x, stay with 0.8.
* As from 0.7 the minimum supported Gradle version is 4.0. (Required if you want Google repository support).
* As from 0.5 the minimum supported Gradle version in 2.8.

== Adding the plugin

.build.gradle
[source,groovy,subs="+attributes"]
----
plugins {
  id 'org.ysb33r.ivypot' version '{revnumber}'
}
----

Or for special cases you might want to do

.build.gradle
[source,groovy,subs="+attributes"]
----
buildscript {
  repositories {
      maven {
          url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/"
      }
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath 'org.ysb33r.gradle:ivypot:{revnumber}'
  }
}

apply plugin : 'org.ysb33r.ivypot'
----

If you are in a restricted environment, you might want to use the second approach and conditionally add the remote reference
to work only when you are in a non-restricted environment. i.e.

[source,groovy]
----
  repositories {
    if(!System.getenv('RESTRICTED')) {
      maven {
          url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/"
      }
    }
  }
----

You might also consider using link:https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/plugins.html#customPluginRepositories[pluginManagement] in `settings.gradle` for this case.

== Defining Remote Repositories

The plugin provides a default task called `syncRemoteRepositories` which is of type `org.ysb33r.gradle.ivypot.OfflineRepositorySync`.
(You are free to create more instances of this task type).

[source,groovy]
----
syncRemoteRepositories {
  repoRoot '/path/to/repo' // <1>

  repositories {  // <2>
    jcenter()
    google()
    mavenCentral()
    mavenLocal()
    maven {
      url 'http://foo/bar'
      credentials {
        username 'pig'
        password 'hog'
      }
    }

    ivy {
      url 'http://foo.bar'  // <3>
    }

  }

  configurations 'compile', 'testCompile' // <4>

  includeBuildScriptDependencies = false // <5>
}
----
<1> Defines the location of the off-line repository root. Must be an absolute path, no relative path.
<2> `repositories` in an implementation of http://gradle.org/docs/current/javadoc/org/gradle/api/artifacts/dsl/RepositoryHandler.html[RepositoryHandler]
  and therefore supports all the standard repository definitions a Gradle user would expect.
<3> Ivy repositories in all incantantions available to Gradle is supported.
<4> Restrict the configurations you would like to have added to the synchronisation process. If none are supplied,
  dependencies from all configurations will be added.
<5> Whether to add dependencies from `buildscript`. (See further down).

== Usage

For normal usage one simply has to point to the local repository. It is assumed that this repository would be committed
to some form of source control or artifact management which is accessible with the restricted environment. The layout of
this repository is a standard Ivy layout.

[source,groovy]
----
repositories {
  ivy {
    url 'file:///path/to/repo' // <1>
    layout 'gradle' // <2>
  }
}
----
<1> Define the path to the local repository here
<2> The default layout is `gradle`. If this has been changed using `repoArtifactPattern` and `repoIvyPattern`, then
  then `layout` should be set to whatever pattern is correct.

== Boostrapping plugins in a restricted environment

Just add the repository to `repositories` closure

[source,groovy]
----
buildscript {
    repositories {
      ivy {
        url 'file:///path/to/repo' // <1>
      }
    }
}
----
<1> Define the path to the local repository here

== Multi-project support

The best way to cache dependencies off-line for a multi-project is to create a special subproject just for synchronisation.


.build.gradle
[source,groovy,subs="+attributes"]
----
plugins {
  id 'org.ysb33r.ivypot' version '{revnumber}' apply false
}

allprojects {
    ext {
        offlineRepoDir = "${rootProject.projectDir}/repo"
    }
}
----

.sync/build.gradle
[source,groovy,subs="+attributes"]
----
apply plugin : 'org.ysb33r.ivypot'

syncRemoteRepositories {

    repoDir offlineRepoDir <1>

    addAllProjects() // <2>

    addProject ':a:b'  // <3>

    addProject ':a:b','compile','testCompile'  // <4>
}
----
<1> Set offline repository root to a variable that is visible to all projects.
<2> Adds all configurations from all subprojects and the rootproject with the exception of the current project. `buildscript` dependencies are not added via this call.
<3> Adds all configurations from project `:a:b` as long as the current project is not called `:a:b`.
<4> Adds only the `compile` and `testCompile` configurations from project `:a:b`. Once again `:a:b` must not be the current project.

Now you just have to run `./gradlew syncRemoteRepositories` or `./gradlew :sync:syncRemoteRepositories` from the top.

NOTE: Also see `src/gradleTest/multiProject` as an example of how this works. (That's actually the compability test we use for multi-projects).

== Caching arbitrary binaries

As from 0.10 it is now possible to cache arbitrary binary files with a path that typically matches that on the server. This is especially useful for people that need to perform tests where binaries are downloaded many times.

=== Configuring binary repositories

[source,groovy]
----
syncRemoteRepositories {
    binaryRepositories {
        nodejs { // <1>
            rootUri = 'https://nodejs.org/dist/' // <2>
            artifactPattern = 'v[revision]/[module]-v[revision]-[classifier].[ext]' // <3>
        }
    }
}
----
<1> The name of the repository. This will also be treated as the group/organisation names.
<2> The root URI of the remote repository. Only `file` and `http(s)` schemes are supported.
<3> A pattern similar to that if Ivy for resolving the artifact path below the root URI.
  This is also used to calculate a relative path for storing the binary locally.
  Note that `classifier` is supported.

=== Specifying binaries locally

If you have one project then the easiest is to specify the binaries within the
`syncRemoteRepositories` task using the `cachedBinaries.add` DSL keyword.

[source,groovy]
----
syncRemoteRepositories {
    cacheBinaries.add 'nodejs:node:7.10.0:linux-64@tar.xz'
}
----

=== Specifying binaries in other projects

It might be useful to rather specify binaries to be cached within the subproject where they are required and then let the syncRemoteRepositories task discover them. In order to achieve this apply a plugin which adds an extension to the `dependencies` block.

[source,groovy,subs="+attributes"]
----
plugins {
  id 'org.ysb33r.binarypot.base' version '{revnumber}' // <1>
}

dependencies {
    cachedBinaries.add 'nodejs:node:7.10.0:linux-64@tar.xz' //<2>
}
----
<1> Adds the `cachedBinaries` extenion to `dependencies` block.
<2> The same syntax is used, but the organisation/group name must match that of a binary repository as defined in `syncRemoteRepositories.

== Adding buildscript dependencies

By default buildscript dependencies will not be added to the synchronisation list. By setting `includeBuildScriptDependencies = true` in
the configuration closure of the task these will be added.

== Patterns

By default the pattern used for writing artifacts is the standard
https://docs.gradle.org/current/javadoc/org/gradle/api/artifacts/repositories/IvyArtifactRepository.html[Ivy Pattern].
This can be changed by setting

[source,groovy]
----
syncRemoteRepositories {
  repoArtifactPattern = '[organisation]/[module]/[revision]/[type]s/[artifact]-[revision](.[ext])'
  repoIvyPattern = '[organisation]/[module]/[revision]/[type]s/[artifact]-[revision](.[ext])'
}
----

NOTE: If this is not specified, the default layout which is known as 'gradle' will be used from 0.4 and onwards.
In the 0.3.x and earlier releases the default layout will be `ivy`. The change was made because it was discovered that
Gradle handles local Ivy repositories sligtly differently and that plugins such as `groovy`, `scala` and `jruby-gradle`
which relies on finding a compiler jar in a certain named way failed when used with the local `ivy` layout.

== Flat directories

The `flatDir` repository supported by Gradle is not supported as it does not make sense. The purpose of this plugin is
to cache remote repositories into a usable local repository. If a user already has a `flatDir` it does not need be be
cached and if need be it can simply be copied.


== Limitations

* The resolution process cannot be fine-tuned at present - not to the level at least which is described
  in http://gradle.org/docs/current//userguide/dependency_management.html#sec:ivy_repositories.
* There are some limitations in Apache Ivy where Maven repositories that redirect artifacts to a different URL will cause failures. A known case are Ruby Gems. There is currently no known workaround.
* It is not possible to cache plugins that are specified in the `plugins` block.  The current workaround is to create a configuration which lists the plugins and their versions and then cache that to the local repository.
